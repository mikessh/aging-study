This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
df <- read.table("age.txt", header=T, sep="\t")

df.y <- subset(df, age >= 20 & age <= 60)
df.o <- subset(df, age >= 60)

ggplot() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 60, linetype="dashed") +
  geom_smooth(data=df.y, aes(x=age, y=naive.of.cd3), method="lm") + 
  geom_smooth(data=df.o, aes(x=age, y=naive.of.cd3), method="lm") + 
  geom_point(data=df,aes(x=age, y=naive.of.cd3)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,100)) +
  theme_bw()

summary(lm(naive.of.cd3 ~ age, df.y))
summary(lm(naive.of.cd3 ~ age, df.o))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
